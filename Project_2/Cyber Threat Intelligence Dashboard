** Introduction 
With the increasing frequency and complexity of cyber threats, cybersecurity professionals need a 
centralized system to monitor incidents, investigate threats, and streamline the response process. CTI OPS 
PANEL addresses this challenge by offering a comprehensive, hacker-style dashboard that aggregates 
threat intelligence, provides actionable analytics, and supports SOC workflows through real-time 
updates and automation. 

** Abstract 
The Cyber Threat Intelligence Dashboard (CTI OPS PANEL) is a web-based platform designed to centralize, 
analyze, and visualize real-time cyber threat data for security operations centers (SOC). It provides live 
threat feeds, search functionality, automated reporting, incident response playbooks, and a user
friendly interface for SOC analysts to detect and respond to security incidents efficiently. 

** Tools Used 
• Backend: Python (Flask), FPDF for PDF export 
• Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
• Libraries: Chart.js (visualization), Leaflet.js (geolocation maps) 
• APIs/Utilities: Mock data with option for live integration, REST/AJAX for feed updates 
• Other: Role-based login, activity log, export to CSV, JSON, and PDF 

** Steps Involved in Building the Project 
1. Backend Setup: Initialized Flask app, built out routes for dashboard, threat feed, lookup, 
login/logout, and exports. 
2. User Authentication: Added session-based login for analyst/admin roles, controlling access to 
features. 
3. Threat Feed & Live Ingestion: Integrated mock data, enabled live feed auto-refresh, and allowed 
manual/additional threat submission via the UI. 
4. Visualization: Used Chart.js for threat summaries and Leaflet.js to plot threat locations on a map. 
5. Search & Incident Response: Implemented real-time threat search; showed contextual incident 
response playbooks in modals for each new threat. 
6. Export & Reporting: Enabled exports of report data in PDF, CSV, and JSON formats using dedicated 
Flask routes. 
7. Audit/SOC Log: Tracked all user actions in a SOC log, viewable as a dashboard section for 
accountability/traceability. 
8.  Recommendations & UI: Displayed security recommendations and ensured a responsive, dark-mode    
hacker UI. 

** Conclusion 
The CTI OPS PANEL project demonstrates a modern, extensible approach to cyber threat intelligence 
operations. By blending live data visualization, threat lookup, incident response planning, and SOC logging 
into a single dashboard, the platform empowers SOC analysts to respond to attacks faster and more 
effectively. This project also serves as a foundation for future integrations with real-world threat 
intelligence APIs, user management improvements, and advanced analytics capabilities.
