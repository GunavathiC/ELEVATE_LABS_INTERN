* Task 1 - Scan Local Network for Open Ports using Nmap

* Objective : 
The objective of this task was to scan the devices on my local network to discover open ports and understand network service exposure and security risks.

* Tools Used
- Nmap (network scanning tool)
- Wireshark (for packet analysis)

## Steps Performed

1. Installed Nmap from the official website.
2. Found my local network IP range using command prompt (`ipconfig`).
3. Ran a TCP SYN scan on the local IP range using:
         nmap -sS 192.__________ (IP address)
4. Recorded the IP addresses and open ports discovered from the scan.
5. Used Wireshark to capture and analyze network packets corresponding to open ports.
6. Researched common services running on the open ports:
- Port 80: HTTP (Web server)
- Port 22: SSH (Secure shell access)
- Port 443: HTTPS (Secure web)
7. Identified potential security risks from open ports such as unauthorized access, data leakage, DoS attacks, and malware entry.

* Conclusion
This task helped me understand basic network reconnaissance techniques and the importance of network security related to open ports.
