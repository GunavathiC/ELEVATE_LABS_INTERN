Objective :
The objective of this task was to use free vulnerability scanning tools to identify common vulnerabilities on a personal computer.
The exercise aimed to provide an introductory experience in vulnerability assessment and an understanding of common PC security risks.

Tool Used :
Nessus Essentials

Methodology :
Installed Nessus Essentials.
Configured the scan target as the local machine IP (localhost).
Initiated a full vulnerability scan.
Reviewed the generated report to identify vulnerabilities and their severity.
Researched simple remediations or mitigations for the detected vulnerabilities.
Documented the most critical vulnerabilities discovered.

Key Findings :
Several vulnerabilities categorized by severity (low, medium, high) were detected.
The scan results helped highlight common security issues such as outdated software versions, unpatched vulnerabilities, and configuration weaknesses.
The highest severity vulnerabilities were prioritized for remediation based on the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) scores provided in the report.

Outcome :
Gained practical experience in using vulnerability scanning tools.
Developed an understanding of the vulnerability scanning process and common PC risks.
Learned to interpret scan reports and prioritize security fixes effectively.
