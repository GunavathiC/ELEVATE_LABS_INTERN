Ojective :
This project demonstrates how to manage basic Windows Firewall rules to control network traffic. 
The steps below show how to add, test, and remove a rule blocking inbound traffic on port 23 (Telnet), using the built-in Windows Firewall interface.

Steps Performed:
Open Windows Firewall Settings
Viewed Current Inbound Rules
Added a Rule to Block Port 23 (Telnet)
Nameded the rule as  Block Telnet Port 23
Tested the Rule using netstat -a -n (in cmd prompt) to check active ports.
Confirmed port 23 was not in use (no Telnet server running), so the rule is ready to block any future inbound traffic on port 23.
Removed the Test Rule and confirmed.

What I Learned :
Windows Firewall uses rules to allow or block network traffic based on ports, programs, or IP addresses.
We can create, test, and remove rules to control our computer’s security.
Even if a port isn’t currently in use, blocking it prevents future unwanted connections.
