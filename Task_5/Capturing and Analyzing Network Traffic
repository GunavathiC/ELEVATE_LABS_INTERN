**Network Traffic Capture and Protocol Analysis using Wireshark

Objective:
The objective of this task was to capture live network packets using the Wireshark tool and analyze the captured traffic to identify basic protocols and traffic types present in the network communication.

Tools Used:
Wireshark

Methodology:
Wireshark was installed and the active network interface capturing live traffic was selected.
Network traffic was generated by browsing websites and pinging servers to create data exchange over the network.
Packet capturing was run for approximately one minute to collect sufficient data.
The capture was stopped and the packets were filtered by protocol to identify different communication protocols.

Protocols Identified:
Three different protocols were identified in the capture:
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Used for transferring web pages and other resources on the World Wide Web.
DNS (Domain Name System): Used to translate human-readable domain names to IP addresses.
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications.

Observations:
HTTP packets contained requests and responses for web pages loaded during browsing.
DNS packets showed the queries sent to resolve domain names of visited websites.
TCP packets were seen managing connection and data transfer between the computer and servers.

Conclusion
This task provided practical experience in capturing live network traffic and analyzing protocol details using Wireshark. 
It reinforced understanding of key network protocols and their role in everyday internet communication.
