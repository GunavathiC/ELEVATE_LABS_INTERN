Password Security 
Task:
This report documents the process and findings for Task 6: Creating and evaluating password strength, summarizing best practices, and preparing for interview questions on password security.

Password          |  Complexity Level  |  Strength Test Result                        
------------------+--------------------+----------------------------------------------
abc23             |  Simple            |  Weak (short, predictable, lacks variety)    
BookShelf2025     |  Medium            |  Moderate (longer, mixes letters and numbers)
T!ger$2025@Moon#  |  Strong            |  Strong (long, mixes cases, numbers, symbols)

Testing Method:
Used passwordmeter.com and Bitwarden Password Strength Tester to evaluate each password.
Recorded feedback and scores for each password.

Analysis & Comparison
Simple password (abc23): Rated weak due to short length and lack of character variety. Easily cracked by brute-force or dictionary attacks.
Medium password (BookShelf2025): Improved length and character mix, but could be stronger with symbols and more randomness.
Strong password (T!ger$2025@Moon#): Rated strong due to length, use of uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. Much harder to guess or crack.

Best Practices for Password Security
Use long passwords or passphrases (12–16+ characters).
Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
Avoid personal info and common words.
Never reuse passwords across accounts.
Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) whenever possible.
Use a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords.
Change passwords only if compromised—frequent changes can lead to weaker choices.

Common Password Attacks
Brute-force attacks: Automated guessing of all possible combinations.
Dictionary attacks: Tries common words and phrases.
Credential stuffing: Uses leaked passwords from other breaches.
Social engineering: Tricks users into revealing passwords.
